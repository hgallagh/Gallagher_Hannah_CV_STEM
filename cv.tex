\textbf{Present Academia Research:} \\ 
My research interests focus on analytic approximations to the Einstein field equations of highly spinning, precessing black hole binaries, including post-Newtonian approximations, black hole perturbation theory, and post-Minkowski expansions. These sources are more astrophysically motivated than their non-spinning counterparts. Understanding these black hole binaries will be crucial for the next stages of multi-messenger astronomy.

\textbf{Broader Technical Introduction and Career Goals:} \\ 
I am primarily enthusiastic about laser research and development driven roles. I have been collaborating within LIGO for over two years now in CBC so a company with version control standards is a must. I thrive in high stress environments as those are where the real work occurs. I am looking for project management and experiment design roles to aid incoming scientists while still learning from lead researchers. I am always searching for new ways to expand my skill set and wish to increase my scientific h-index and collaborate via conferences through APS ,OSA, and SPIE. Any guidance and points to professional textbooks and papers are welcome. I would love the ability to be sponsored for higher security clearance.
